# Methods {#Designs}

We describe our methods in this chapter.

## T-test 

Let's try to do a one way T-test:

``` {r}
#library
library(ggridges)

#Calculations

my_data <- lincoln_weather

result.t.test <- t.test(my_data$`Mean Temperature [F]`, my_data$`Mean Humidity`, paired = FALSE)

result.t.test

```

We can conclude that there is in fact a relationship between the mean temperature and the mean humidity in Lincoln, Nebraska _p_ < 0.01.
