## Why you want to do this

Using a version control platform (such as [GitHub](https://www.github.com)) facilitates collaboration on projects from multiple people (while restricting the number of *versions* of the collaborative material). RStudio integrates really easily with GitHub, so it turns out to be a very useful way to share scripts and work on projects such as [this one!](https://github.com/jtkulas/GitHub)

## How to integrate RStudio and GitHub

You need to install "Git" onto your computer before using GitHub through RStudio.

This [site](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) and the next few slides walk you through the setup.

## Installing Git 

Git is platform tool, which helps connect the website [GitHub](https://github.com/), and R studio. To install Git on you computer go to website &lt;https://git-scm.com/downloads&gt;. Here is what the website should look like:

## What's a "Shell"?

You may be asked to operate from within a "shell" (you don't need to do so, but the recommended resource does ask you to use a shell). A shell is an access point to your computer that operates somewhere behind your operating system (for example, Windows). You can access shells outside of RStudio, but if you'd like to access a shell from *within* RStudio, you can also do so - the "Terminal" tab within RStudio is actually a "shell":

## Part 1: Connect Git to R 
.pull-right[
- Go to Tools in RStudio; it is between Profile and Help. 
- Then, click on Global Options
- Next, click on Git/SVN 
]

.pull-left[

## Part 2: Connect Git To R

![](Image/SVN 2.jpg){width=35%}

- On a windows computer, you go to "this PC"
- Click on "Windowns (C:)"
- Click on "Program Files Folder"
- Click on "Git Folder"
- Click on "bin folder"
- Click on "git.exe"

You are now connect to Github with Rstudio.

---

## Example of how to use it.

- You will go to New Project.
- Then, you go to verison control, and click on Git.
- Now, you want go to Github, and click on code, then highlight the link. Like below:

![](Image/Connect.png){width=65%}


- Paste it in to repo

## Problem Solving

[This error](https://codewithhugo.com/fix-git-failed-to-push-updates-were-rejected/) was very common, so with the current presentation, we had to bypass it via this command (in the R Studio `terminal` pane)

![](Image/hardboot.png)

---

## Options

You can set up notifications via your *global* options (associated with your account - not specific to any one repository):

![Notifications](Image/notifications.png)


---

## Connecting individual accounts to shared projects (Step I)

Invite collaborators from within the GitHub repo:

![](invite.png)

...you'll need their GitHub username

---

## Connecting individual accounts to shared projects [(Step II)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM)

First access the GitHub repository url, then, within the R Studio interface follow the wizard via: File `\(\rightarrow\)` *New Project* `\(\rightarrow\)` Version Control `\(\rightarrow\)` Git `\(\rightarrow\)` paste the GitHub repository address into the "Repository URL:" window.

Note that you'll also indicate a local (on your computer) location for the files...

![](projectnew.png)


---

## Connecting individual accounts to shared projects (Success) 

You now have a "project" that you can access from within R Studio, but is linked to the GitHub files (as well as somewhere locally on your computer)

![](linked.png)

---

## Then what?

You can now work on shared .Rmd files via local editing. A "commit" saves your edits, whereas a "push" sends your saved changes (aka "commits") to the online GitHub repository.

There's a decent YouTube overview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLycV1IWqc)

![](commit.png)

---

## Using the repository

Especially with shared projects, every time you access the project, make sure to "pull" - this will ensure that you have (locally) the most up-to-date information that is located on the shared repository:

![Pulling](pull.png)

## [Forking vs. branching](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/the-definitive-guide-to-forks-and-branches-in-git#:~:text=Forking%20creates%20a%20full%20copy,what%20branch%20you%20are%20using.-)

Sounds like forks are different paths that a project may take (e.g., point of divergence) toward a different end-goal, whereas branches are shorter-term (typically) "construction zones" where edits can be temporarily held before being integrated into the master branch.

---

## Defining a new branch

Best practice seems to entail creating a branch within which proposed edits can be made and reviewed prior to "pulling" these changes to the master branch (the master is where the initial files were placed, but also where the final product will be located).

You can create a new GitHub branch from within RStudio via the `New Branch` option on the `Git` tab of RStudio's "Environment/History" panel:

![](branch.png)

## Lingering questions...

What are all of these files? (they keep multiplying)

![](whatdis.PNG)

Heya

---

## Tasks for next meeting

+ figure out push and pull
+ how to request a change
+ how to stage

---

## Notifications

In order to recieve notification that a push has been made to a repository that you own, navigate to the repository, then indicate up to 2 e-mails that you would like to "sign-up" for... 

![](notification.png)
---

## Notifications (II)

If you wish to recieve notifications from a repository that you collaborate on (but do not "own"), you can select to watch that repository:
